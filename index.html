            <h1>A/B Testing Assignment</h1>
            <h2>The Assignment</h2>
            <p>
                For this assignment, I had to run a simple A/B test on two different 
                UI designs and analyze the results. From the results, I will draw 
                conclusions on whether a design choice could hvae reasonably 
                impacted user interaction. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Two Interfaces
            </h2>
            <h3>Data Collection: Interface A</h3>
            <p>
                To start, as a class, we all used Interface A to <b>make an 
                    appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on 
                    April 23, 2024</b>. 
                Then, we were given 30 minutes to make changes to Interface A 
                that would impact the user's flow in completing the task. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The changes I made to Interface A for Interface B: 
                <ul>
                    <li>correcting the order of dates</li>
                    <li>adding a grey background to see which appointment the user
                        is hovering over</li>
                    <li>making the font darker</li>
                    <li>making the buttons for appointments more notciable</li>
                    <li>adding a hover feature to the buttons to show when the 
                        user is hovering over a button</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <div class="column">
                <h2>Interface A</h2>
                <img src="version-A.gif" atl="Interface A Demonstration"> 
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h2>Interface B
                </h2>
                <img src="version-B.gif" atl="Interface B Demonstration"> 
            </div>
            <h3>
                Data Collection: Interface B
            </h3>
            <p>
                After we finished our changes, as a class, we all used Interface B 
                to <b>make an 
                    appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on 
                    April 23, 2024</b>.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I then saved all the data from the uses of the two Interfaces
                to perform statistical analysis on whether or not the changes
                I made were significant. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Analysis
            </h2>
            <p>
                For the analysis portion of this assignment, we were tasked with
                creating three hypotheses to test. 
                
                We had to create hypotheses about 
                <b>misclick rate</b> and <b>time on page</b>, and were given a choice
                for the third hypothesis we were to test. I chose to hypothesize about 
                and test the <b>time to first click</b> on the page because I made changes
                to my interface that I hoped would allow the user to find their 
                desired appointment quicker, leading to a quicker time to first 
                click on page B than page A. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Hypothesis 1: Misclick rate
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>H_0 </b>
                = There were the same amount of misclicks on page A and page B.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>H_1 </b>
                = There were fewer misclicks on page B than page A. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason behind this alternative hypothesis is that I want to 
                see that my changes on Interface B led to fewer misclicks than Interface A. 
            </p>
            <h4>Predictions</h4>
            <p>
                I predicted that we will be able to reject the null hypothesis 
                because I designed Interface B to show different colors for 
                both the appointment slots and the buttons, hopefully showing the 
                user where to correctly click to make an appointment. 

            </p>
            <h4>
                Statistical Test and Results
            </h4>
            <p>
                For this hypothesis, I performed a chi squared test to measure 
                the differences in frequencies of misclicks. 

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        chi-squared statistic = 31.613
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        p-value = 0.001
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null 
                hypothesis, determining that there is significant difference 
                between the frequencies of misclicks on page A and page B. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Hypothesis 2: Time on page 
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>H_0 </b>
                = Users spent the same amount of time on each page. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>H_1 </b>
                = Users spent less time on page B than page A. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason behind this alternative hypothesis is that I want to 
                see that my changes on Interface B led to users not having to spend
                as much time searching the page to get to their appointment. 
            </p>
            <h4>Predictions</h4>
            <p>
                I predicted that users will spend less time on Interface B than
                Interface A because they will have an easier time finding their 
                appointment. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Statistical Test and Results
            </h4>
            <p>
                For this hypothesis, I performed a two tailed t-test to determine
                whether or not there is statistical difference between the means 
                of the two groups of data. 
                <ul>
                    <li>T-score = 4.609 </li>
                    <li>P-value = 0.001</li>
                    <li>Degrees of Freedom = 23.289</li>
                </ul>

            </p>
            <p>
                Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null 
                hypothesis and determine that there is statistical difference 
                between the mean of time spent on page A and the mean of time 
                spent on page B. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Hypothesis 3: Time to first click 
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>H_0 </b>
                = The time to first click on page A and page B were the same. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>H_1 </b>
                = The time to first click on page B was faster than the time to 
                first click on page A. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason behind this alternative hypothesis is that I want to 
                see that my changes on Interface B led to users finding their 
                appointment quicker without clicking on elements of the page that 
                were not helpful to making their appointment. 
            </p>
            <h4>Predictions</h4>
            <p>
                I predicted that the null hypothesis will be rejected and we will 
                find statistical difference between the time to first click for 
                Interface A and Interface B because Interface B was created in a 
                way that it made the process of scheduling an appointment more 
                obvious to the user in hopes to reduce the time to the first click. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Statistical Test and Results
            </h4>
            <p>
                For this hypothesis, I performed a two tailed t-test to determine
                if there is statistical difference in the means of time to first
                click on each interface. 
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        T-score = 5.233
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        P-value = 0.001
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Degrees of Freedom = 22.035
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null 
                hypothesis that the time to the first click on page A and page B 
                were equal, noting that there is statistical difference between 
                the means of the time to first click for page A and page B. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Summary
            </h2>
            <p>
                Through hypothesis testing, I can determine that Interface B 
                is better than Interface A for fewer misclicks, less time spent
                on the page, and less time to first click. The changes that I made
                to Interface A for Interface B led to changes in the way that users 
                interacted with this interface. Some pitfalls of this type of 
                A/B testing is that there were not many responses to the interfaces
                were we can acutally determine if the changes made were significant.
                We would need to test on a much larger scale and with people 
                who are not familiar with the interfaces in order to perform 
                real A/B testing. Overall, this was a great experience to be
                able to learn about the process of A/B testing, how to create
                hypotheses to test, choosing correct tests for hypotheses, and 
                analyzing results.
